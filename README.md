# CLUBCAL

Say hello to ClubCal, the easy way for your organization to compile information in one location for your organization members to easily view.

ClubCal allows organizations to use a Google Sheets document to store information about specific events happen within and around your organization. Thanks to our programs, the changes on the sheets get automatically updated on the programs on every local device, allowing multiple users with the programs installed to easily view the information stored in an easily presentable format. In addition, out program allows users to have local notes for events for personal use, without affecting any other user's application or the global calendar. ClubCal is a simple and comprehensive tool that can be used by any organization to easil present their information to users with just one document.

# HOW TO USE

To view the calender for a specific organization, simply download this repository, navigate the folders using this path: 

HACK-main -> Calender -> dist -> GUI.exe

Running this file allows the user to view the calendar tied to this specific organization. Currently there is only one google sheet tied to the runnning of the application. Tailored versions of ClubCal are still being developed and will be available in a future release. The current release is more of a demo version of what the program can achieve in the future.

# DEVELOPERS AND INFORMATION
